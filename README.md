Y is an Ethereum smart contract between payer and payee, usually buyer and seller. Rather than buyer paying seller directly, buyer sends Ether to Y, Y donates some of that to something the buyer thinks is important and sends the rest to the seller. The seller determines how much is donated.

Sellers can use Y to make more sales by attracting custom from buyers who care about something enough to donate to it, such as a charity or a public service, or even themselves (i.e. a discount)... the decision is theirs. And rather than hoping that the seller is paying tax, buyers can see for themselves that a seller is giving something back to society... it's written into the contract.

## Development

Y is part of [AgileVentures](https://www.agileventures.org/projects/y), and we mob program on it every [Thursday at 5pm UTC](https://www.agileventures.org/events/y-mob-programming). If you'd like to work on it with me at other times, including now, contact me through Y's channel on AgileVentures' Slack.
